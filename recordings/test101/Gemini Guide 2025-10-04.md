## Mission Control
This session was a foundational dive into Artificial Intelligence, specifically focusing on search algorithms. It began with practical demonstrations of integrating external APIs (Wikipedia) and custom Python functions as "tools" within an AI agent framework (LangChain). The core of the lecture then shifted to the theoretical underpinnings of search problems, introducing key terminology like agents, states, actions, and goal tests. The session culminated in a detailed explanation and visual comparison of Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS), highlighting their mechanisms, advantages, and disadvantages in finding solutions within a state space.

## Key Concepts & Definitions
- **`doc_content_chars_max`** (00:00:00) — A parameter for the Wikipedia API wrapper that controls the maximum number of characters retrieved from a Wikipedia page.
- **Custom Tool** (00:01:45) — A Python function wrapped to be used by an AI agent, requiring type hints for its parameters for proper model interaction.
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** (00:04:30) — Any instance where a computer performs a task that appears intelligent or rational (e.g., facial recognition, game playing, NLP).
- **Search** (00:04:30) — A core AI concept involving finding solutions to problems, such as driving directions or game moves.
- **Agent** (00:07:45) — An entity that perceives its environment and acts upon it.
- **State** (00:07:45) — A specific configuration of the agent within its environment.
- **Initial State** (00:07:45) — The starting configuration of the agent, the beginning point for any search algorithm.
- **Actions** (00:07:45) — Choices that can be made in any given state, formally defined as a function `actions(S)`.
- **Transition Model** (00:07:45) — A description of the state resulting from performing an action in a given state, formally defined as a function `result(S, A)`.
- **State Space** (00:07:45) — The set of all possible states reachable from the initial state through any sequence of actions, often visualized as a graph.
- **Goal Test** (00:07:45) — A mechanism to determine if a given state is a goal state.
- **Path Cost** (00:07:45) — A numerical value assigned to a sequence of actions (a path) indicating its "expense" (e.g., time, distance).
- **Search Problem** (00:07:45) — Defined by an initial state, available actions, a transition model, a goal test, and a path cost function.
- **Solution** (00:07:45) — A sequence of actions that takes the agent from the initial state to a goal state.
- **Optimal Solution** (00:07:45) — A solution with the lowest path cost among all possible solutions.
- **Node** (00:16:50) — A data structure used in search algorithms to keep track of the current state, parent node, action taken, and path cost.
- **Frontier** (00:16:50) — A data structure containing states to be explored, initialized with the initial state.
- **Expand Node** (00:16:50) — The process of finding all reachable neighbor states from a given node and adding them to the frontier.
- **Explored Set** (00:20:30) — A set of nodes that have already been visited and expanded, used to prevent infinite loops.
- **Stack** (00:22:45) — A Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) data structure. When the frontier is implemented as a stack, it performs Depth-First Search.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)** (00:22:45) — A search algorithm that explores the deepest node in the frontier first, going deep into one path before backtracking.
- **Queue** (00:22:45) — A First-In, First-Out (FIFO) data structure. When the frontier is implemented as a queue, it performs Breadth-First Search.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** (00:22:45) — A search algorithm that explores the shallowest node in the frontier first, expanding uniformly outwards from the initial state.

## Study & Revision Checklist

### Theory
- [ ] Review the definitions of all key AI concepts introduced (Search, Knowledge, Uncertainty, Optimization, Machine Learning, Neural Networks, NLP). (00:04:30)
- [ ] Understand the five components that define a search problem: initial state, actions, transition model, goal test, and path cost function. (00:07:45)
- [ ] Differentiate between a "solution" and an "optimal solution" in the context of search problems. (00:07:45)
- [ ] Memorize the structure and purpose of a `Node` data structure in search algorithms (state, parent, action, path cost). (00:16:50)
- [ ] Trace the general search algorithm approach, including the role of the frontier and the explored set. (00:16:50, 00:20:30)
- [ ] Compare and contrast Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS), focusing on how they use the frontier (Stack vs. Queue) and their exploration patterns. (00:22:45)
- [ ] Understand the implications of DFS and BFS on solution optimality and memory usage (e.g., DFS might not find optimal, BFS finds optimal but can be memory-intensive).

### Practice
- [ ] Experiment with the Wikipedia API wrapper:
    - [ ] Change `doc_content_chars_max` to 1000 or 10000 and observe runtime and content length. (00:00:00)
    - [ ] Try passing other parameters like `language` or `load_all_available_metadata` if available in the provided code. (00:00:00)
- [ ] Implement the `save_to_TXT` custom tool as demonstrated. (00:01:45)
    - [ ] Ensure correct type hinting for function parameters (`data: str`, `file_name: str`). (00:01:45)
    - [ ] Integrate the custom tool into an agent and test its functionality by prompting it to save research data. (00:01:45)
- [ ] Review the provided code for `maze.py` to understand the implementation of `Node` and `StackFrontier`. (00:22:45)
- [ ] Mentally or physically trace DFS and BFS on a simple graph or maze example to solidify understanding of their mechanics. (00:22:45)

### Admin
- [ ] Locate the GitHub repository for the course code, as mentioned by the instructor. (End of first segment)

## Risk & Follow-ups
- **Potential Pitfall**: Forgetting type hints in custom tool functions can lead to unexpected behavior or errors when the AI model tries to call them.
- **Potential Pitfall**: Understanding the trade-offs between DFS (memory-efficient but not always optimal) and BFS (optimal but potentially memory-intensive) is crucial for choosing the right algorithm for a given problem.
- > [!warning] Clarify: The instructor mentioned a code link in the description. Ensure this link is accessible and contains the demonstrated code for the API wrapper and custom tool.
- Follow-up: Are there specific problem sets or coding challenges related to implementing DFS and BFS that will be assigned?

## Next Moves
- **Implement** the custom `save_to_TXT` tool in your local environment and verify its functionality.
- **Review** the provided `maze.py` code (once located) to understand the practical implementation of `Node` and `StackFrontier`.
- **Prepare** questions on the practical implications of choosing between DFS and BFS for different problem types for the next class.
